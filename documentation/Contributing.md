## Code Style
We have some code style guidelines that help make the code easier to read.
We mainly use PyLint for static code analysis with specific configuration files for
[demos](../demos/.pylintrc),
[tests](../tests/.pylintrc) and the
[code base](../phi/.pylintrc).

Additional style choices
- Long lines are allowed.
- Code comments should go in the same line as the code they refer to (if possible).
- Code comments that title multiple lines preceed the block and have the format `# --- Comment ---`.
